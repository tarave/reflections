1) It helped me to see where the error was at. Then it was easy to pinpoint.
2) Having version control would really help control the changes and allow you to see what changes
to the code are resulting in the various outputs that you are seeing
3) I theink the pro is that you get to pick when to commit. The con is that you might 
forget to do it.
4) Google docs is usually dealing with files that don't interact whereas code frequently interacts
across files.
5) You use git log to see all the different versions of the files in the repository, then you
use git diff to compare the different versions of those files.
6) You would always know that you could revert to a version that worked.
7) I want to use git to check out the various version of this text file!
